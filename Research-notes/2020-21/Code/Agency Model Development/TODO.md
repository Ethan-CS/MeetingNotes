- [ ] #Soon Method to contribute to peril rating: based on overall number of infections in some (variable) radius. Say, infected vertices with a shortest path of 3 or less from $v$ contribute to the peril rating as well as or instead of the shortest path to the closest infected vertex.
- [x] -> open; 1 -> defended; 2 -> burning. Consider making these values named constants. Also, `// Value of 1 if vertex (index) is burning, 0 otherwise (defended or open)` - again, consider a named variable, makes code easier to come back to and understand later
- [ ] #LongTerm Optimise how we determine burning: especially in cases with relatively little burning, it may be faster to maintain a list of burning vertices (class attribute?) and traverse it instead/in addition to traversing the whole state.
