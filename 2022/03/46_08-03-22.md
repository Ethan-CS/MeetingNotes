_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

This meeting was only 2 working days after the previous meeting, so several to-dos are outstanding from the previous meeting.

Jess has agreed to Ethan taking some time off in April.

Jess gave Ethan the dates for the Scottish Combinatorics meeting (founded by Kitty) in May.


## 2. Research

Ethan has managed to begin experimenting with ER graphs - as an example, this plot shows box plots representing 50 experiments for each probability value from 0.01 to 0.2 in increments of 0.01 on ER graphs on 15 vertices.

Jess also made several helpful comments on section 3 of Ethan's ongoing Overleaf document. Ethan should review these comments and make these amendments in the coming week. 

Ethan has several oustanding to-dos since the last meeting (as this was only two working days ago), so he should prioritise these tasks over the coming week.


## 3. Plan

**Practical:**
- [x] (This week - continue from last week) ER Experiments
- [x] (This week) implement tests to ensure number of tuples produced for paths and cycles by code is what we'd expect from analytically derived expressions

**Writing:**
- [x] (This week) Editing pass - address Jess' comments on section 3 of Overleaf doc
- [x] (This week, depending on how practical side goes) Write up approach to ER experiments as these are done
- [x] (Could require some thinking, maybe a while) Go back to 3rd criterion - rework because walks only works for paths

**Planning:**
- [x] (This week - continued from last week) Plan future experiments (this could lead onto actual work in next several weeks):
	- What do I want to know for each graph class? I.e. write down research questions hoped to answer
	- How will I find out (code to write, already have some code)?
- [ ] (This week) plan out a talk for BCC in case funding application submitted is accepted


## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: plan, as above. Provide holiday dates to Jess next time.

Jess: no follow-up.
