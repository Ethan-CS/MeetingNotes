### Questions & thoughts:

Plenty of existing work on SIR and SIS (can become reinfected) networks models. Generally three approaches here:
- Take averages at population level,
- Maintain a probabilistic view where full state space is considered, or
- Modelling starts at level of nodes <- _The approach the authors take._

Existing challenges:
- Extending results for loop-less networks to networks with loops or clustered networks (where clustering and presence of loops is closely related).
- Developing low-dimensional approximate/exact models to match output directly from the stochastic process.

Aims:
- Exact, deterministic representations of Markovian $SIR$ epidemics on networks with and without loops
- Identify link between structural properties of the networks and viability of closures that allow us to write exact systems that can be numerically evaluated.

Equations considered start at level of nodes and consider exact probability of a node being in a given state at a certain time. _In particular, they show the link between cut-vertices and bridge vertices and the feasibility of closures._

**Consider:**

Focus on the details of closures when they appear: closures are found using identification of cut-vertices or bridge vertices. Can we generalise their argument for single cut-vertices to cut-vertex sets?
