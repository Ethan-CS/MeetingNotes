# PHD MEETING

__Meeting 39__
18-01-2022


_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Meetings are now set weekly for Tuesdays at 10am.


## 2. Research

Ethan showed Jess thhe work he has done to identify 'anomolous' tuples in Toast - tuples that his equation generation procedure would identify as required, but that do not occur in the original paper. The two decided that the best course of action here is to get in touch with the original authors, as there does not seem to be an obvious reason for this.

Further, Ethan showed Jess an Overleaf project he has been working on since his FATA talk describing algorithmic approach to equation generation. In particular, Ethan wanted Jess to look at his procedure complexity analysis, for which Jess had several helpful suggestions.
- Begin with naive bound - we can do better than this, starting with the $nCr$ coefficient.
- Do we need the $nPr$ term in the next upper bound? Why? Bounds look a little suspicious, going from i=k to n should not be necessary. Try and remove permutation.


## 3. Plan

Ethan:
- [ ] Draft an email to corresponding author of original paper about differences in required tuples for Toast.
- [ ] Rework upper bound equation based on discussion with Jess

Jess:
- [ ] Glance over rest of Overleaf document and make any suggestions

## 4. Follow-up
