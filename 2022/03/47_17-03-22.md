[< Previous](46_08-03-22.md) | [Next >](48_21-03-22.md)

_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Ethan's holiday dates:  12/04/22 to 01/05/22 (if this works and is not too long in one go).


## 2. Research

Ethan asked Jess to review amended proofs and added corollary during the meeting. Jess suggested that one corollary is likely to be a special ($SIR$) case of a more general result, which Ethan should aim to identify and prove.

Ethan also walked Jess through some analytical work he has found and extended for a possible upper bound on feasibility on ER graphs, which Ethan should continue to explore.


## 3. Plan

**Practical:**
- [X] (This week) Further random graph experiments

**Writing:**
- [ ] (This week) Correct corollaries and theorem with notes from discussion
- [ ] (Continuing from last week, depending on how practical side goes) Write up approach to random graph experiments as these are done

**Planning:**
- [ ] (This week) plan out a talk for BCC in case funding application submitted is accepted

## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: plan as above.

Jess: no follow-up.
