## Abstract
[[DEF. Percolation|Percolation]] on 2D [[DEF. Small-world|small-world]] networks has been proposed as a model for spread of plant diseases. Authors aim to give analytic soln. of this model with generating function methods and high-order series expansion. Soln. gives predictions for quantities such as:
- Position of percolation threshold
- typical size of disease outbreaks as fn. of density of "shortcuts" in small-world network
Results agree with scaling hypotheses and numerical solns. for same model.
