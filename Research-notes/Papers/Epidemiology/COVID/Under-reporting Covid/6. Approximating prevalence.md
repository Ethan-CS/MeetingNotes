## Approximating prevalence

Authors use adjusted case curves inb [[Fig1]], adjusted further for under-reporting and for asymptomatic infections as proxy for prevalence.

In particular, they sum total adjusted new cases per day over the preceeding ten days and calculate percentage of population in question this value represents.

This process provides a crude prevalence estimate - they assume ten days of infectiousness as taken from mean of total infectious period.
