### Questions & thoughts:

Consider a general nth order system of differential equations  
$$
\Delta_v(x, u^{(n)}) = 0, ~~~~~v = 1,\dots,m
$$

in $p$ independent variables $x = (x^1,\dots,x^p)$, and $q$ dependent variables $u = (u^1,...,u^q)$, with u(n) denoting the derivatives of the u’s with respect to the $x$s up to order $n$. This system of differential equations, which we often abbreviate as $\Delta = 0$, is thus defined by the vanishing of a collection of differential functions $\Delta_ν:J_n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined on the $n$-th jet space $J_n$. (For simplicity, we will restrict our attention to systems defined by smooth functions, although extensions of these methods to more general systems are possible.) The system can therefore be viewed as defining (or defined by) a variety

$$
S_{\Delta}=\left\{ (x, u^{(n)}) | \Delta_v(x, u^{(n)})=0, v=1,\dots,m \right\}
$$

contained in the nth order jet space, consisting of all points $(x,u^{(n)}) \in J_n$ satisfying the system. The defining functions $\Delta_v$ are assumed to be regular: in a neighborhood of $S_∆$; in particular, this is the case if the Jacobian matrix of the functions ∆ with respect to the jet variables (x,u(n)) has maximal rank m everywhere on ν n 􏰁p+n􏰂

S∆.
