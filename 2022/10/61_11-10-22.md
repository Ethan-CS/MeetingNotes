_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Some meetings previous to this, but discussion was getting re-acquainted with current work, progress, goals and blocks. This is a summary meeting to understand state-of-play of current work.

## 2. Research

Ethan currently working towards a paper draft by end of year (which will form a chapter of his thesis). For this, he is designing and performing several experiments:
- Comparison scatter/heat plot:
	- Closures vs. full system performance
		- Just generation
		- Generation and solving
	- Closures vs full system vs Monte Carlo
- Accuracy of approximations, time to solve within certain accuracy compared to full system

Ethan is currently completing code for equation generation and aims to produce at least a full system vs. closures plot by next meeting.


## 3. Plan

Coding, as above.



## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: plan, as above.

Jess: none.
