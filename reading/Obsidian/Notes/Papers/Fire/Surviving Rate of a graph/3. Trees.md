## Trees

Begin with simple observation: if firefighter protects vertices $U={u_1, u_2, ..., u_t}$ succesivley to save $k$ vertices in a graph $G$, for any spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$, they can protect these vertices in the same order to save at least $k$ vertices in $H$. This implies the following connection between surviving rates of a graph and its spanning subgraphs:

***For any spanning subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$, we have that ***$\rho(G)\leq\rho(H).$

This implies that in all graphs, trees have highest surviving rates as every connected graph contains a spanning tree. Because we can save at most $n-d(v)$ vertices when a fire breaks out at a vertex $v$, every tree $T$ satisfies:
$$
\displaystyle \begin{align}
\rho(T)\leq\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{v\in V}(n-d(v)) &=1-\frac{2m}{n^2} \\
&=1-\frac{2}{n}+\frac{2}{n^2}
\end{align}
$$

Note that trees attaining this upper bound are [[DEF. Caterpillar|caterpillars]], where distance bwteen every pair of vertices of degree at least 3 is not equal to 2, shown by [[Papers/On minimising the effects of fire/0. Meta|Finbow et al.]] in study of graphs with min. expected damage.

$n$ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
$\rho(T)$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{5}{9}$ | $\frac{5}{8}$ | $\frac{17}{25}$ | $\frac{13}{18}$ | $\frac{36}{49}$, $\frac{37}{49}$ | $\frac{49}{64}$, $\frac{50}{64}$ | $\frac{63}{81}$, $\frac{64}{81}$, $\frac{65}{81}$

In ensuing section, aim to prove that surviving rate of every tree on $n$ vertices is greater than $1-\sqrt{2/n}$, which tends to 1 as $n\to\infty$. They use and prove two relevant lemmas:
- (3.2) For every path $P$ on $k\geq 2$ vertices in a tree $T$, $\text{sn}(P)>(k-2)n$
- (3.3) For every rooted subtree $S$ of height $h\geq0$ in a rooted tree $T$, $\text{sn}(S)\geq(n-h-1)|S|$, where $|S|$ is the number of vertices in $S$.

This second lemma gives us that the surviving rate of a tree of small diameter is close to 1, where the *diameter*, \text{diam}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum pairwise distance in $G$.

Corollary (3.4) For every $n$-vertex tree $T$, $\displaystyle\rho(T)\geq1-\frac{\lceil\text{diam}(T)/2\rceil+1}{n}$.
