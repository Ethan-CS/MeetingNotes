_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin


## 2. Research

Ethan came with two systems of equations that he had generated - in both cases, the system differed to the systems reported in the papers outlining the original procedure. Jess and Ethan discussed some potential ideas as to why the generated sets of equations and reported systems differed, but concluded that the best course of resolution would be to contact Istvan Kiss, one of the original authors, to clarify. Ethan will draft an email for Jess to send and hopefully arrange a meeting.

Ethan has been continuing his work on simulation code and aims to begin plotting in the coming week.

Ethan has also continued working on research questions and a thesis statement for the APR.


## 3. Plan

**Practical:**
- [ ] Continue simulation code, with an aim to come up with plots in the next week.

**Writing:**
- [ ] Continue APR prep (research questions, thesis statement).

**Planning:**
- [ ] Draft email to Istvan for Jess to send and organise a meeting to clarify system of equation discrepancies.



## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: plan, as above.

Jess: send email to Istvan Kiss when Ethan has drafted.
