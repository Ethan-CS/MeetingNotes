## 1. Admin


## 2. Research

Ethan has been producing plots of experimental data to ensure pipeline for experimental output is up and running. He now plans to further experimental results, including implementing and comparing results to a Monte Carlo simulator, to add figures and results to current working paper.


## 3. Plan

- [ ] Check - any info on special issue of CMSB proceedings?
- Current plots:
	- [ ] Updates with new data (currently running)
	- [ ] Faster way to use solver? Look into SciPy hints
-  Monte Carlo:
	- [ ] Look for a package that may help - if none suit requirements well, direct implementation should not take too long
	- [ ] Define a stopping condition - perhaps a couple, one that we expect to lead to faster output of results
	- [ ] Output comparisons of exact method and MC approach

When this has been completed, move on to look at approximations and bounding their accuracy.





## 4. Follow-up
