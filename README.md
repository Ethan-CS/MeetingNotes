This repository contains various files associated with my PhD research, which is based around the topic "Game-theoretic and probabilistic methods applied to spatial network models of contagion". To find out more about my research and interests, see: [Ethan Kelly](https://gla.ac.uk/pgrs/ethankelly/)

Below is a rough roadmap to the contents of the repo.

## Contents:
* `meeting-notes` 
  * This directory contains plain-text notes from PhD supervisory meetings, beginning 06-10-2020 that record any administrative tasks and topics, points of research discussion and any follow-ups for either Jess or myself and my own plan for the week to come.
* `percolation`
  * Contained here is a 'dummy' literature review, in that it is being written for my own practice and to help me develop as a researcher. I am using this to be able to research with a purpose more than to have a useable or publishable lit review (although parts may be repurposed for this in future). The subdirectory version-history contains previous backups of this project, and above all else proves an interesting timeline of my growth and progression as I naviagte the literature surrounding Percolation and the Firefighter Problem.
* `proposal` 
  * This contains a pdf of my original research proposal, submitted in June 2020.
* `reading` 
  * Here, I save pdf articles and record notes from the reading I have been carrying out as part of background research and reviewing the work done in my field of interest. Also here are backups of my Obsidian vault, where I take most of my notes; more information about Obsidian and how it can help with effective note-taking here: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
