## Temporal variation model fitting

Authors estimate level of under-reporting on every day for each country that has had more than ten deaths.

They fit a [[DEF. GaussianGaussian Process|Gaussian Process]] (GP) model using library greta and greta.gp - the parameters are:

Parameter | Description
------------ | ------------
$\sigma$ ~ Log Normal$(-1, 1)$: | Variance of the reporting kernel
$L$ ~ Log Normal$(4, 0.5)$: | Lengthscale of the reporting kernel
$\sigma_{\text{obs}}$ ~ Truncated Nomal$(0, 0.5)$: | Variance of observation kernel, truncated at $0$.

The kernel is separated into the reporting kernel $R$ and observation kernel $O$. The reporting component has a standard squared-exponential form. For observation component, authors use an iid noise kernel to account for observation overdispersion, which may smooth out overly clumped death time-series. This is significant as some countries have reported very large and unusual numbers of deaths on a single day owing to past under-reporting.

In sampling and fitting process, they then calculate expected number of deaths at each time-point, given baseline CFR. They then use a Poisson likelihood with expected number of deaths is rate of the Poisson likelihood, given observed number of deaths.
