## Definition: CFR

Case fatality rate/ratio - proportion of deaths from particular disease compared to total number of symptomatic people diagnosed with disease.

CFR of a given disease can be changed through medical interventions.

CFR conventionally expressed as a percentahe, represents a measure of the lethality of a disease.

Differs importantly from mortality rate as it does not take into account duration from onset to resolution of disease. CFR can only be considered final when *all* the cases have been resolved (died or recovered).

## Naive CFR (nCFR)

Definition used in this paper - ratio of reported deaths to date to reported cases to date. This will always be an underestimate of true CFR as the outcome (recovery or death) is unknown for all cases. Cite: Kucharski AJ, Edmunds WJ.
