## 1. Admin


## 2. Research

Updates for this week:
 - Fixed code so solver now works correctly (albeit slowly, still want to look into other fixed-step solver options within SciPy framework)
 - Completed MC code, which:
	 - Gets solution, runs until average is within tolerance of solution for given number of simulations
	 - Runs until average is within tolerance of previous average for given number of simulations
 - MC is MUCH faster - about half a second for something that would take equations 30s (without looking into faster fixed-step solvers)
 - HOWEVER MC sometimes times out before it reaches the output from equations. Could mean either equations are incorrect, solver isn't working properly or I'm not letting MC run for long enough
 - No plots yet - want to refine and refactor first (including more robust testing, to investigate this issue with MC run to average) before coming up with plots and conclusions, but that should be finished up this week

Reminder of next steps for paper:
 - Plot comparing runtimes for equations: full system v. closures
 - Plots comparing runtimes for equations: closures on different {density ER graphs, types of trees with limitations, graphs with small cycles}
 - Plot comparing equations (with closures) to MC approach with similar parameters/run to same solution
 - Plot(s) similar to above with more complex compartmental model, see how that changes things
 - Write up counter example for closures on larger cutsets
	 - Understand discrete case
	 - Write a continuous case
