### Introducing features of agency into computational models of infectious disease

Computational models of disease often begin with games on graphs (also known as networks). Some work has been done using the Firefighter Problem as a basis for epidemic modelling, but this has its limitations when we wish to produce models with realistic features of agency in individuals.

In Firefighter, vertices in a graph represent trees and somewhere on the graph a tree catches on fire. Then, we can defend a vertex, preventing it from catching fire. The fire then spreads to all adjacent vertices, we can deploy another defence and so on until the fire can't spread any further or we can't defend anything else. By swapping 'fire' for 'infection' and 'tree' for 'individual', we quickly have a rudimentary model for disease spread. This, however is where current work becomes sparse - what we aim to discuss is how to extend these models with a focus on agency-related features. In particular, we will discuss how using ideas from compartmental modelling approaches in graph models can result in a ready-made agency framework for use in Firefighter and whether we could use a dynamical systems approach for such an extended model.

Key points of discussion:
* Current computational approaches to graph models of disease 
* Extending existing graph models to better account for individual agency
* Introducing a compartmental modelling approach
* Algorithmically assessing the feasibility of a dynamical systems approach to compartmental graph models
