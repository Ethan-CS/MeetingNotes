## Abstract

Present a framework to simulate SIR processes on networks using weighted shortest paths. Framework maps SIR dynamics to weights assigned to the edges of the network, which can be done for [[DEF. Markovian Processes|Markovian]] and non-Markovian processes. Weights represent propagation time between adjacent nodes for particular realisation. Dynamics are simulated by creating an ensemble of such realisations, e.g. using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, through direct sampling. Former provides runtime advantage - if realisations from all possible sources computed as weighted shortest paths, they can be recalculated more efficiently. This framework is applied to three empirical networks, they analyse expected propagation time between all pairs of nodes and further use framework to perform efficient source detection and to improve strategies for time-critical vaccination.
