# AgencyModel: Questions to explore

-----

### Questions & thoughts:

Q: How does adding a state (protected) impact the number of equations used to describe an SIR network model?

Q: How can we make the graph more complex (useful) but only with a small increase in complexity of computation and solving time?**

**Consider:** In the paper, we see a modelling framework that extends previous work which provided exactness of closures at the level of triples for Markovian SIR dynamics on tree-like networks (and a deterministic representation of epidemic dynamics on the network that can be evaluated numerically).
