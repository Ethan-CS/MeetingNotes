## Summary of Methods
- Claim: finding ratio of dividing deaths to date and cases to date leads to biased estimate of case fatality ratio [[DEF. CFR]] since this calculation does not account for delays from confirmation of a case to death and under-reporting of cases.
	- I think they mean case fatality rate, which is usually expressed as a percentage rather than a ratio. The claim is true *a posteriori* by virtue of the definition of CFR. CFR should not yet be calculated as it is only accurately determined once all cases have been resolved, through death or cured, it is not a predictive figure but a descriptive one .
- Use distribution of the delay from hospitalisation to death for fatal cases to estimate number of cases expected to have known outcomes (death or recovery) and hence adjust naive estimates of CFR to account for delays
- Such adjusted CFRs do not account for under-reporting. Best available estimates of CFR in $1 - 1.5\%$ range. Work assumes baseline CFR of $1.4\%$ for analysis.
- If country has adjusted CFR that is much higher, e.g. $20\%$, this suggests only a fraction of cases have been reported - e.g. $1.4$ (baseline) divided by $20$ gives $7.0\%$ cases reported approximately
- Paper then uses these under-reporting estimates to adjust confirmed case curves to arrive at adjusted new cases per day cuirves and prevalence estimates
- Prevalence estimates are calculated by tallying up over the last 10 days pf adjusted incidence, serving as a crude proxy for prevalence.
