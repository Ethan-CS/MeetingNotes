## Adjusting for outcome delay in [[DEF. CFR|CFR]] estimates

[[DEF. CFR#Naive CFR|Naive CFR]] (nCFR) - ratio of reported deaths date to reported cases to date. This, in an outbreak, will underestimate true [[CFR]]

Assumption: delay from confirmation to death followed same distribution as estimated hospitalisation to death, based on data from Wuhan in Dec 2019 and Jan 2020. Accounts for right-ceonsoring in data as result of yet unknown disease outcomes - see [[Fig1]]. Distribution used: [[DEF. Log-normal Distribution|Lognormal fit]], mean delay of 13 days and standard deviation of 12.7 days.

Authors use case and death incidence data to estimate proportion of cases with known outcomes to correct CFR:
$$\displaystyle u_t =\frac{\sum^t_{j=0}c_{t-j}f_j}{c_t}$$
where $u_t$ is underestimatiion of proportion of cases with known outcomes and used to scale value of cumulative number of cases in denominator in the calculation of the cCFR; $c_t$ is daily case incidence at time $t$; and $f_t$ is the proportion of cases with delay of $t$ between confirmation and death.
