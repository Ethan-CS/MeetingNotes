## Rules

This file contains a Java project that plays the (North American version of) Blackjack. This is subject to the following rules:
* Each player is dealt 2 cards. The dealer is dealt 2 cards, one face-up and one face-down.
* Cards are equal to their value; face cards are worth 10 and an Ace can be 1 or 11.
* The player's cards are added up for their total.
* Players “Twist” to gain another card from the deck. Players “Stick” to keep their current card total.
* Dealer “Twists” until they equal or exceed 17.
* The goal is to have a higher card total than the dealer without going over 21.
* If the player total equals the dealer total, it is a “Push” and the hand ends.
* Players win their bet if they beat the dealer. Players win 1.5x their bet if they get “Blackjack” which is 21.
