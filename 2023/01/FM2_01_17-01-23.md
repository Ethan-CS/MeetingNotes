**Discussion points (given before the meeting):**
Meeting invite includes room booking, so booking a 2-hour slot to ensure we have the room for at least that long. We may not end up needing that much time…  

**Questions to think about:** 
  
+ General modus operandi for doing this
+ The overall form the course can/should take
+ Any particular topics you personally would like/not-like to do
+ Should we reach out to specific academics in the school to get their input about topics of interest? Maybe do a wider survey? I’d like to talk to at least 1-2 people who teach AI/ML courses, feels like we won’t be doing “due diligence” otherwise, but not so sure if we want to widen the circle, might start getting too many/unrealistic demands.
+ Should we be trying to connect with someone in the Maths department?
+ Assessments: MCQs vs more advanced features of Moodle vs something else?
+ How ML/AI oriented do we want to be?
+ Should we look at some education/scholarship literature around design of such courses, or just get on with it based on relevant texts and other online resources.

**Notes from earlier**
  
There is some prior work; hopefully gives us a toehold:  
  
+ The course is the second of a two-part theme, the theme being “Foundation Maths for Computing Science and Software Engineering”.  
Both courses have had their outlines approved by the School:

The “course support document” for both:

+ The first course has been running for a couple of years now, and is offered to incoming GA students before they start their first term. It is meant to be a self-paced course that one could do online completely on their own. We do however have weekly tutorial sessions when this course officially runs. I don’t conduct or record any lectures, and what I have done here is best described as: Curation, Narration, (occasionally, Demonstration), and Evaluation. The evaluation is done through a sequence of 5 online tests, with only pass/fail grade, all open book, and student have multiple attempts (with some new and some old questions at every attempt). So quite relaxed/permissive. I use the moodle “book” feature to organize all material. No reason to continue with this format for the second course automatically though, we can work with whatever makes more sense for it.  
  
You can see this first course here (use guest access):

I have unit-wise feedback collected over 3 years for this course, happy to collate and share. In general, have not found any strong objections to the course format, students seem to like it.  
  
+ As you will note from the course outlines, the first course is loosely “pre-calculus”, and the second one is meant to be focussed on: Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Probability & Statistics. We can revisit these learning outcomes; the ultimate aim really of this second course is help students cope with honours-level courses that have a strong maths component. AI/ML are perhaps the main “culprits” here, but there are other courses too, e.g. Robotics.   
  
I added some of these elements, but _very_ light-touch, as a 5th unit to the first course this year:

Towards the end of this unit, I point to more advanced resources, and some of these resources could be used as a reference for designing the second course.

+ We reached out to some colleagues earlier who teach honours level “mathsy” courses, about the maths they require; that is collated here:

We could consider getting feedback like this from a wider pool of instructors in the School via a questionnaire?


## Discussion

- Regular meetings for us to plan and help course develop: once every fortnight.
- trace.dcs.gla.ac.uk
	- like a local version of Moodle, used for GAs before they have GUIDs
	- This is where the level 1 currently lives
	- Can move to regular moodle and back without too many problems
- From the L1 Foundation Maths course
	- Self paced, marks don't mean anything for progress/degree/etc.
	- Progression checklists - encourage students to take ownership, check before next unit opens
	- Can record videos on Moodle only up to 2mins - good for introducing topics
	- Some 'deep dives' - extra stuff, enjoyable for those interested but can be entirely skipped without comprimising learning outcomes
	- Uses BBC Bitesize - feedback often says that, if learner has not seen topic before, this seems insufficient as an introduction
- Assessment for this course - what is currently done in progression quiz in L1 course
	- probably around 25-ish questions
		- Can have Moodle select from a larger pool of questions and randomise the order
	- Should be part of the learning journey, we should be able to use the flexibility we have gained from this not being credited (yet)
	- Feedback can be given either generally (no matter your answer) or per answer (e.g. trick questions)
	- Can have placeholder variables, give Moodle an equation to find correct answer and even provide tolerance (within this range, accept as correct)
	- Can use REGEX with free text answers, can even have drag-drop or drop-down question
	- Format: default MCQ (including drop-down), we will see if anything else lends itself to other, more advanced formats
		- This can take a very long time!
- ILOs:
	- Linear Algebra
	- Calculus
		- Differential Equations
	- Complex numbers
	-  Basics of probability and statistics
