# PHD MEETING

15-11-2023

_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Hunter_


## 1. Admin

 - Several previous meeting notes on paper, will type up when possible.
 - Next week: meeting on Monday at 9am due to clash.

## 2. Research

Jess read two sections of Ethan's Firefighter work in the meeting.

**MSO section.** Check the following:
 - Check $b$ variables in inputs - should they be subscripted, could they vary?
	 - Can we replace all $d$ variables with a set, to use set-in operations there too? Would be much simpler
 - Get someone (e.g. Laura) to check MSO work, make sure we are 'allowed' to do everything done here

**Verification of PathContainable in poly time.** Conditions 2 and 3  cannot be verified in poly time in general, as e.g. cost function could depend on state of entire graph, meaning we would have to enumerate every possible state. However, Ethan should consider a hierarchy of cost functions - e.g. $c(v), c(v, \textrm{number of burning neighbours}), c(v, \textrm{state of graph})$ - and state that for some of these we can verify 2 and 3 in polynomial time.
