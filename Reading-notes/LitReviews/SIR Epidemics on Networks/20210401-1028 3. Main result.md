# 3. Main result for networks with loops

**Previous note:** [[20210331-1808 2. Background and Examples]]

### Questions & thoughts:

Main result reveals important relation between structure of the network for the epidemic model and type of closures that are feasible. Two important structural properties are _cut-vertices_ and _bridges._ Cut-vertices are "single nodes whose removal leads to disconnected components or sub-networks." Bridges are edges that lie between two cut-vertices.

**Theorem 1 (main result)** 
Let G \= {V,E} be a network with N vertices (V \= {1,2,...,N}) and a set of edges given by E. Consider a connected subset of vertices F \= {v1, v2, . . . , vk} ⊆ V , and assume that ∃vi∗ ∈ F , a cut-vertex in G, such that F \\ {vi∗ } is partitioned into at least two disjointed components with vertices F1 \= {v1, v2, . . . , vi−1} and F2 \= {vi+1, vi+2, . . . , vk} belonging to any such two, distinct and disjointed components or subnetworks. Then the following equation holds:

$$
\langle Z_{v_1} Z_{v_2}, \dots Z_{v_{i-1}} S_{v_i*} Z_{v_{i+1}} \dots Z_{v_k} \rangle (t) =
\frac{
	⟨Z_{v_1} Z_{v_2} \dots Z_{v_{i-1}} S_{v_i*}\rangle(t)
	\langle S_{v_i*} Z_{v_{i+1}} \dots Z_{v_k} \rangle}
	{\langle S_{v_i*} \rangle (t)}
$$  
where $Z_{v_i} = S$ or $I$ $\forall v_i \neq v_{i∗}$ , and $\langle \cdot \rangle$ denotes the probability of a given subgraph being in a given state at a given time.

Authors then show that the given "intuitive closures" are special cases of this.

**Consider:**

Seems like my code would need some machinery for identifying _cut-vertices_ and _bridge edges._ Not sure how to get started here - worth looking into some other code examples, e.g. search GitHub? Could then use this identification to generate closures using the equation given in Theorem 1 (above).
