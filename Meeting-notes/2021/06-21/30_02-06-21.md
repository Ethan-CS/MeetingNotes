# PHD MEETING

__Meeting 30__
02-06-2021


_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Ethan had some very kind messages in response to his conference talk last week (the reason for the usual PhD meeting being cancelled) and he has had a meeting with a PhD student in virology who he is hoping to collaborate with, working on some real-world transmission data.


## 2. Research

Jess and Ethan went over Ethan's (still in progress) annual progression report. Jess made some very useful suggestions:
- In introduction, include a subsection outlining work so far, so that the reader can see the significance of work discussed in literature review
- Include more of the algorithmic side of Firefighter (e.g. NP-hard even on trees)
- Start of lit review, outline role each section plays in own work to date, e.g. percolation mainly for future work
- Order lit review and work so far by priority, i.e. percolation last since this has not been used as much as stuff from other sections
- Fig 1 doesn't add too much to the report, might be worth either explaining more in caption or (if short of space) cutting altogether
- Worth mentioning which of the two main approaches percolation fits into (could be both?)
- Fig 5 and 6 (flow charts) could go side-by-side
- Agency-oriented modelling section could include some plots and discussion of results obtained (currently reads like this has not yet been implemented)
- Could mention somewhere that the two strands of approach so far are related by focus on introducing protection into models that don't already have this in
- 3.3.1 could have shorter definitions/explanations of $S$, $I$ and $R$ since they have already been defined above
- Bottom of p. 9 - not a probability!
- 3.3.2 - could mention importance of Kiss paper in foundations of algorithmic approach to generating equations
- Again in 3.3.2, could make it clearer that we mean _vertices_ for individuals (or remove initial reference to individuals entirely)
- 3.3.3 - Make it clearer that this is new work  - implies that 3.3.1 and 2 could go in lit review?
- Again in 3.3.3, could explain that Kiss et al suggest an algorithmic approach would be a good idea, Ethan has addressed this open problem
- Also discuss that Ethan has been working on bounding numbers of equations required.
- Research plan: discuss goals _and methods,_ ensure concrete
- PRISM goal - should be under the more formal approach section?
- Measures of success might include e.g. submitting 2 papers/abstracts/posters to conferences/journals, such as BMC


## 3. Plan
