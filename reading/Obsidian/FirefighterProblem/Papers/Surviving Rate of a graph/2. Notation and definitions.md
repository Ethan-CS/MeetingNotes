## Notation and definitions

All graphs taken to be connected undirected simple graphs with $m$ edges and $n\geq 2$ vertices. For a graph $G=(V,E)$ and vertex $v\in V,$
- $d(v)$ - degree of $v$ in $G$.
- $N(v)$ - set of neighbours of $v$, i.e. those vertices adjacent to it.
- A $d$-vertex is a vertex of degree $d$; we denote by $V_d$ and $n_d$ the set and number of $d$-vertices in $G$ respectively.
- $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$.
- For a subgraph $H$ of $G$, $\text{sn}(H)$=\sum_{v\in V(H)}\text{sn}(v)$ is the surviving number for $H$.
- $\overline{\text{sn}}(H)=\text{sn}(H)/|V(H)|$ denotes the average surviving number for $H$.
- A *rooted tree* is a tree $T$ with one vertex $r$ chosen as the *root.*
	- For each vertex $v$ in $T$, its neighbour on the unique $(r,v)$-path in $T$ is the *parent* of $v$ and each of the other neighbours of $v$ is a *child* of $v$.
	- A vertex $u$ is a *descendant* of $v$ if $v$ is on the unique $(r,u)$-path in $T$.
- A *rooted subtree* $T_v$ of $T$ is the subtree of $T$ consisting of $v$ (the root of $T_v$) and all other descendants of $v$.
- The *height* of a rooted tree $T_r$ is the length of a longest root-to-lead path and the height of a vertex $v$ in $T_r$ is the height of the rooted subtree $T_v$.
