## Abstract
Diffusion processes are determined by external triggers and internal dynamics. Effective control of infectious disease requires understanding diffusion processes - difficult, as pathways to infection are invisible. Authors aim to propose new diffusion framework incorporating stochastic processes, modelling disease by seeing human mobility as topological pathways in heterogeneous social systems. Utilise [[06102020-2231 Bayesian Inference|Bayesian]] inference with stochastic [[DEF. Expectation-Maximisation algorithm|Expectation-Maximisation algorithm]] to quantify diffusion dynamics in exogenity and endogeneity, and further estimate cross regional infection flow on Granger causality. 

## Significance
Infers probabilistic infection routes of a vector-borne disease by modelling internal dynamics of metapopulations driven by human mobility as multivariate stochastic processes. Using this, proposed model can uncover self-excitation and mutual excitation nature of disease spread across heterogeneous social system with rich context.
