Exogeneity is a basic assumption in regression analysis: it states that independent variables $X$ are *not* dependent on the dependent variable $Y$. NB: this doesn't entail there is no connectio, between $X$ and $Y$, since $Y$ is dependent it will depend on independent variable(s) $X$ and on the error term. When used to refer to a variable, it denotes a particular variable being independent of other variables in the system: 

***an exogeneous variable is able to influence the system without being influenced by it.***
