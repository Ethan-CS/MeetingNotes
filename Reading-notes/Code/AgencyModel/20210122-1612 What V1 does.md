# V1 update: What this version does

**Previous note:** [[Programming Overview]]

### Questions & thoughts:

First pass at setting up the code I'm going to need for this project. I've got lots of tests strewn in the code and the organisation is a bit of a mess, so please don't think too much about this version. I've backed it up as it does some really key things:
* Initialises a graph, represents as an adjacency matrix and prints to the console (for verification)
* Gets a random vertex in the graph to start the contagion at
* Creates agents to get assigned to each vertex, with some particular attributes
    * `vertex` - the vertex it has been assigned to
    * `peril` - the peril rating, value between 0 and 1. A function of distance to the nearest infected vertex - 0 if no path from agent to an infected vertex, 1 if they are infected or directly next to an infected vertex.
    * `protection` - baseline random protection rating between 0 and 1, overall protection is that if peril is 0 and increases with increasing peril otherwise.
    * `state` - susceptible, infected, protected for the time being. Protected if peril is 0, infected if peril is 1 (needs to change (peril is 1 if infected or adjacent to an infected agent) and susceptible otherwise.
* Prints the status of each agent - the four attributes above - so I can verify that the methods are working as intended.
