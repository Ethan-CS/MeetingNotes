# Summary: Lit review of _Markovian SIR Epidemics on Networks_ paper

-----

### Questions & thoughts:

I'm hoping to write a brief and precise summary of the paper [[markovian.pdf | Exact Deterministic Representation of Markovian SIR Epidemics on Networks With and Without Loops]]. This paper underpins a lot of the concepts I am using for my current research (particularly equation generation), so it makes sense to try and create the basis for a literature review of this!

-----
 
**Consider:**

When complete, this should be a good addition to the equation generation document (on GitHub, in LaTeX). It should also help pin down the process for identifying closures, which I need to implement in the code project still.
