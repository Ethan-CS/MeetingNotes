## Adjusting case counts for under-reporting

The authors adjust number of cases per day pulled from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ECDPC - https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide .

In particular, they divide case numbers each day by their estimates 'proportion of cases reported' that they calculate each day for each individual country.
