_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Several meetings not typed up - some because mostly reading over manuscript recently submitted, others notes exist physically so will retrospectively add.

Jess is away at a conference next week, next meeting is in two weeks time.


## 2. Research

Mostly working on APR3. Some discussion on when and why Weighted Dynamic Firefighter (WDF) is polynomial time solvable (four conditions discussed, written in research notes repo) and whether a dichotomy result is possible for these conditions in this variation. 

Ethan has a lot of work to do to get up to speed with complexity.


## 3. Plan

**Practical:**
- [ ] Maths - think about 4 conditions in research notes, prove any initial results
- [ ] Watch lectures on complexity (parameterised and hardness) by Eric Demaines from MIT, available on YouTube

**Writing:**
- [ ] Continue with APR3



## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: plan as above.

Jess: no follow up.
