This repository contains various files associated with my PhD research, which is based around the topic:

**_Game-theoretic and probabilistic methods applied to spatial network models of contagion_**

To find out more about my research and interests, see: [Ethan Kelly](https://gla.ac.uk/pgrs/ethankelly/)

Below is a rough roadmap to the contents of the repo.

## Contents:
* `firefighter`
  * This is an ongoing project, where I am writing code that can come up with solutions to a given Firefighter graph (such as (GreedyFirefighter)[firefighter/GreedyFirefighter.java], which uses the Greedy algorithm to produce a 1/2 - approximation for Firefighter). The Firefighter Problem briefly is: given a graph (represented as an adjacency matrix), choose a random vertex v to be the initial point of outbreak. Then, the firefighter gets a defence per turn and the fire spreads to any open (unprotected and not on fire) vertices, the firefighter defends again, the fire spreads and so on. The  optimal program will centre around an integer program that aims to throw an optimal defence solution to Firefighter on a given graph.
* `meeting-notes` 
  * This directory contains markdown notes from PhD supervisory meetings, beginning 06-10-2020 that record any administrative tasks and topics, points of research discussion and any follow-ups for either Jess or myself and my own plan for the week to come.
* `percolation`
  * Contained here is a literature review, written for my own practice and to help me develop as a researcher. I am using this to be able to read and carry out research with a purpose more than I am doing this to have a useable or publishable lit review (although parts may be repurposed for this in future). The subdirectory `version-history` contains previous backups of this project, thereby providing an interesting timeline of my growth and progression as I naviagte the literature surrounding Percolation and the Firefighter Problem.
* `proposal` 
  * This contains a pdf of my original PhD research proposal, submitted in June 2020.
* `reading` 
  * Here, I save pdf articles and record notes from the reading I have been carrying out as part of background research and reviewing the work done in my field of interest. Also here are backups of my Obsidian vault, where I take most of my notes; more information about Obsidian and how it can help with effective note-taking here: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
