There are a number of open source, mature libraries for Java that offer graph implementations.


### JGraphT
[[https://jgrapht.org/|JGraphT]] is one of the most popular libraries for graph data structures in Java. It permits creation of simple, directed and weighted graphs and much more.

### Google Guava
[[https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained|Google Guava]] is a set of Java libraries that provide many functions, including graph data structure and its algorithms. It supports creating simple `Graph`, `ValueGraph` and `Network` and these can be defined `Mutable` or `Immutable`.

### Apache Commons
[[https://commons.apache.org/sandbox/commons-graph/|Apache Commons]] is an Apache project offeirng reusable Java components, including Commons Graph whih gives a toolkit for creating and managing graph data structure. This provides common algorithms on graphs.

### Sourceforge JUNG
[[http://jung.sourceforge.net/|Java Universal Network/Graph]] is a Java framework providing a great deal of language useful for modelling, analysing and visualising data represented as a graph. JUNG supports many algorithms, including routines such as clustering, decomposition and optimisation.


The above libraries provide many implementations based on the graph data structure. There are more powerful frameworks based on graphs, which include [[https://giraph.apache.org/|Apache Giraph]] (used by Facebook to analyse graph formed by their users) and [[https://tinkerpop.apache.org/|Apache TinkerPop]].
