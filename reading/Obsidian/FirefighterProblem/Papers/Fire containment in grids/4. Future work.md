## Future work

The authors suggest the following as future avenues of research:
- Models of responses to fire and disease spread
- Infinite graphs: what is the minimum number of firefighters needed per time step so that only a finite number of vertices are burnt?
	- [[DEF. Percolation|Percolation]] can be explored as methods that may be applicable to these problems
- For an arsonist or bioterrorist, they would like to know the most vulnerable vertices in a graph.
	- A vertex $v$ is most vulnerable if a fire outbreak starting at $v$ bruns the most vertices of $G$ given an optimal firefighter response.
	- Can the most vulnerable vertices in a graph be determined without knowing the optimal firefighter response? Can they be pre-emptively defended?
- Network architect: want to desig graphs resistant to such attacks. 
- Similar questions if there are $k$ outbreaks of fire.
- Firefighter can be viewed as a one-player game - what if the fire has a choice too? It can only spread to $d$ neighbours each time step, forming a two player game. What strategy should firefighters employ to minimise the number of burnt vertices?
