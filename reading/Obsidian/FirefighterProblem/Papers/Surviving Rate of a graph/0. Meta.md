## Abstract
Authors consider firefighter on $G=(v,E)$.  Denote by $sn(v)$ the max number of vertices firefighter can save when fire breaks out at a vertex $v$ of $G$. Denote by $\rho(G)$ the *surviving rate* of $G$, defined as the average percentage of vertices possible to save when fire breaks out at any randomly selected vertex, i.e. $$\rho(G)=\sum_{v\in V}\frac{\text{sn}(v)}{n^2}$$. In their paper, they aim to prove that for each tree $T$ on $n$-vertices, $\rho(T)>1-\sqrt{2/n}$. Further, they show that $\rho>1/6$ for every [[DEF. Outerplanar graphs|outerplanar]] graph $G$ and $\rho(H)>3/10$ for every [[DEF. Halin graphs|Halin]] graph $H$ with 5 or more vertices.

Key words: firefighter problem; surviving rate; tree; outerplanar graph; Halin graph.

The authors give notation and definitions in [[2. Notation and definitions|section 2]] and then move onto lower bounds on surviving rates of trees in [[3. Trees|section 3]], outerplanar graphs in [[4. Outerplanar graphs|section 4]], Halin graphs in [[5. Halin graphs|section 5]] and conclude with future directions and open problems in [[6. Concluding remarks|section 6]].
