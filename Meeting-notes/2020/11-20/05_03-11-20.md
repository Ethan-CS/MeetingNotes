_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Jess mentioned Friday meetings she has set up with Kitty M. to provide a round-robin between graduate students and postgrads, where each attendee has 5 minutes to discuss the progress they have made in the last week, any roadblocks they have come across and what they hope to achieve in the following week. Ethan agreed that this would be useful in seeing who is working in similar areas and encourage collaboration, especially in helping to dissolve roadblocks some are experiencing.

Ethan, as of next week, will have tutorials to run 14-16:00 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, until the end of this semester, so Jess agreed to move the weekly meeting to _Thursdays at 12noon._


## 2. Research

### OptimalFirefighter.java

* 'Silly optimal solution finder'
  * Get every permutation of vertices in graph
  * Determine which are possible defence strategies
  * Run them all, decide which is the most optimal defence
* Exhaustive (combinotorial) search
  * Search trees may be useful in understanding implementation of this
  * One player version of search trees: defence choice branches, fire doesn't (similar to formal logic tableaux; _or_ rules branch, _and_ rules don't)
  * Use this thinking to implement code that examines all possibilities (as above) but only considers relevant (i.e. possible) defence strategies, does so in less time and with less consideration of irrelevant permutations
* Integer Program
  * Ethan will need to go and research different Java packages that might allow implementation and solve an integer program for Firefighter
  * Specify the problem to consider in Java, use the solver in package
  * This may not end up being very useful long-term, but a good thing to have if needed in future
  * Look at: Google OR-tools
  * Jess may have supervised a previous student that implemented something similar; she will follow up on this.
  
From proposal, Jess noted that they had both intended to consider a more agency-based approach. Some examples of things to consider this week to align coding with this approach:
* Give each vertex a "rating" based on protection from contagion. In context of COVID:
  * Someone entirely isolated would have a rating of close to 1
  * People who still go out often but take lots of precautions such as mask wearing, hand washing etc. may have rating closer to 0.5
  * Someone taking no precautions would have protection rating closer to 0.
* Given these ratings, how does the contagion spread?
  1. Perhaps we define the contagion as spreading only to vertices with a protection rating less than, say 0.5
  2. More complex: contagion spreads with probability that is related to behavioural (protection) rating
  
In the case of (1), how big is the remaining graph? This is a percolation problem; the intervention process could perhaps be trying to reduce the connections until we reach percolation threshold, thereby containing the fire to a cluster of the original graph. How do we do this, i.e. do we defend based on structural or behavioral (defence) properties?

Another question Jess brought up: what if we instead considered exerting some influence on the graph, instead of defending in binary terms? That is, we are given say a value _n_ that indicates the number of vertices we can influence, we could ensure all _n_ of those vertices are increased in baseline defence by 100%, or we could for instance increase the defence rating of _2n_ vertices by 50% and so on. For this, Jess suggested looking at Ising models - these are defined as models of spin in physics, but Ethan should be able to translate this to contexts both are interested in.


## 3. Plan
Ethan:
* Write at least code for 'Silly optimal solution finder'
  * See if this could be used to introduce some element of behaviour/defence rating as described above
* Do some initial reading on Ising Models
* Look at packages available for Integer Programs in Java (if continuing in Java)
  * Don't implement too much until Jess has followed up about potential code from previous student

## 4. Follow-up

Ethan:
* Follow plan as above
* Continue with teaching, including new tutor work on Tue and Wed.
* Attend meeting on Friday morning with suitable (minimal) preparation for round-robin discussion of:
  * Successes this week
  * Road blocks come across
  * Aims for coming week, including how to get around road blocks

Jess:
* Look up implementation of agency based Firefighter from previous student and let Ethan know if there is anything he can potentially use/access
