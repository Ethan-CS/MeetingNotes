FIREBREAK: possible to create a firebreak of some given size in a graph and protect a desired number of other vertices from being burned by a fire that breaks out at some vertex$v\in V(G)$?

FIREBREAK:
	Instance: A graph $G$, integer $k$, integer $t$ and vertex $v_f\in V(G)$
	Question: Does V(G) contain a $k$-subset $S$ s.t. $v_f\notin S$ and the number of vertices of $G-S$ separated from $v_f$ is at least $t$?
	
This resembles [[DEF. Firefighter Problem|Firefighter]] where the defender makes all their moves (constrained by e.g. budget) in one go before the fire starts. Firebreak can be used to describe, for instance, contagion from a single point in a network and where a one-time response is to be employed in reaction to immediate onset.

Authors also consider KEY PLAYER: let $c(G)$ denote number of connected components of graph $G$ and $G-S$ to be subgraph of $G$ induced by vertices of $V(G)\setminus S$:

	Question: Does $V(G)$ contain a $k$-subset $S$ s.t. $c(g-S)\geq t$?
