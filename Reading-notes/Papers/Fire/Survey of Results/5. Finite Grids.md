# Finite Grids

### Proposition 5.1
In $P_nxP_n$, when the fire breaks out at $(r,c)$, $1\leq r \leq c \leq \lceil{\frac{n}{2}\rceil}$, if the firefighter defends vertices in the following order: $(r+1, c), (r+1, c+1), (r+2, c-1), (r+2, c+2), (r+3, c-2), (r+3, c+3), ..., (r+c, 1) (r+c, 2c), (r+c, 2c+1), ..., (r+c, n)$, then $n(n-r)-(c-1)(n-c)$ vertices are saved.

### Proposition 5.2
The strategy described in proposition 5.1 saves the maximum number of vertices when $r\in\{1,2\}$.

The difference between the number of vertices saved by the strategy in Proposition 5.1 and the best known upper bound on the number of vertices that can be saved becomes arbitrarily large, as a function of $n,$ as the vertex at which the fire starts approaches the middle of the grid.

### Conjecture 5.3
For any vertex $v$ of $P_n\times P_n\times P_n$,
$\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\textrm{MVS}(P_n\times P_n\times P_n, v; 1)}{n^3}=0$
Let $G$ be the subgraph of the 3D infinite square grid induced by the vertices with non-negative coordinates and at distance at most $3n$ from the $(0,0,0)$. Then $G$ contains $P_n\times P_n\times P_n$ as an induced subgraph.

### Theorem 5.4
Let $G$ be the subgraph of the 3D infinite square grid induced by the vertices with non-negative coordinates and at distance at most $3n$ from the $(0,0,0)$. Then,
$\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\textrm{MVS}(G, (0,0,0); 1)}{n^3}=0.$
