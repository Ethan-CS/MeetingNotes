## Introduction

Description of first instance of firefighter problem and common applications of solutions and algroithmic approaches.

All graphs considered in this paper are connected, finite, simple and undirected. All vertices are either burning or not and one firefighter is trying to control outbreak. A vertex is saved if it is not burned at the end of the process. 

This has been considered in several contexts: finite and infinite graphs, cubic graphs and trees, for instance. This has been studied from structural and algorithm perspectives.

[[DEF. k-firefighter|k-firefighter]] considered in this paper.

In contrast to [[DEF. Firefighter Problem|Fiefighter]], in which the fire has no strategy, the choice of strategy for the fire is important in $k$-firefighter. 

The authors concentrate efforts in calculating the surviving rate for $k$-firefighter in particular contexts, e.g. wheels and some prisms.
