# Abstract
Firefighter Problem aims to save max number of vertices of graph as possible from fire spreading through graph. Problem is NP-hard even when input graph is bipartite or a tree of max degree 3. Paper aims to show that FIREFIGHTER can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs, split graphs, permutation graphs and P_k-free graphs for fixed $k$. 

# 1. Introduction
FP is notoriously hard. The only polynomial-time algorithms known for Firefighter are on graphs of maximum degree 3 when fire starts at a vertex of maximum degreev 2 and on P-trees.
