## 1. Admin

Agenda:
- Main aim: paper comparing exact, dynamical modelling approach to Monte Carlo simulation approach
	- Sub-aim: conference in September, prepare a poster on the work in the main aim paper.
	- Sub-aim: results for paper -
		- Graphs with polynomially many connected subgraphs
		- Heuristic analysis
- Main aim: collecting work so far into a thesis repository, potentially a LaTeX template, and using this to focus work going forward
	- Sub-aim: source a template or organise work in a reasonable way
	- Sub-aim: go over work from first year -
		- (For reference) [first-year annual progression report](https://github.com/ethankelly/AnnualProgressionReview/blob/main/EthanKellyProgressReport.pdf)
		- Collect what can be currently used (e.g. lit review)
		- Identify ways can be extended (i.e. actual research, rather than review)


## 2. Research

Jess provided several very helpful ideas for next stage of Ethan's research, drawing on work from first and second years. This is only to be embarked upon after current paper is completed and ideally submitted.

- Work already done: agency-based modelling	
	- On a graph $G$, each node $v$ has some ttribute $A(v)$, a real number between 0 and 1, corresponding to agency
	- Different ways of setting this value, including random and distance to closest infection/fire at $t=0$
	- Several heuristic methods of deploying protection in this formulation of Firefighter
- We can formalise two variants of Firefighter based on this:
	- Weighted-Firefighter-Static: where agency is assigned at the start of the game and not amended as time goes on
	- Weighted-Firefighter-Dynamic (Peril-Firefighter): agency is determined by a function of time
- For each of these variants, we want to find out:
	- Are they also formally hard (most likely, and reduction would not have to be too formal)?
	- Are there specific restrictions (e.g. to the graph we play on) that make this easy, i.e. solvable with a poly-time algorithm?
	- How do heuristics perform? General solvers?
- Jess had a new idea: Good Behaviour Firefighter
	- Two spreading processes - first, usual fire; second, spread of protection from neighbours who have been directly protected
	- Want to know same information about this as other two variants of firefighter
	- Can bring in equations work with an SIRP system, where P is seeded in initial conditions and then allowed to spread (whereas usually we could implement further protection each turn, as with Flood-It)




## 3. Plan

Long-term plan:
- [ ] Complete current paper on dynamical versus stochastic simulation compartmental models
- [ ] Write up firefighter variants top form a more coherent narrative from firefighter to agency-based modelling
- [ ] Consider future research direction, based on above discussion.
