## Definition: Log-normal distribution

Continuous porbability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normall distributed. Log-normally distributed random variables take only positive real values.

If random variable $X$ is log-normally distributed, then $Y=\ln(X)$ has a normal distribution. Equivalently, if $Y$ has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of $Y$, $X=e^Y$ has a log-normal distribution.
