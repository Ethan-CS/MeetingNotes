In this section, we aim to outline some of the influential work that lies within the scope of the proposed work.

One very comprehensive piece of writing, that serves almost as a catalogue or textbook for the Firefighter Problem, is by Finbow and MacGillivray.[^1] This paper provides a firm foundation for the formalised Firefighter Problem and mentions an array of potential applications along with previous work in such veins. They note that there is a great deal of writing surrounding contagion of diseases and ideas in small world and networks with power-law degree distributions, and that many of these models employ probabilistic methods to some extent.
