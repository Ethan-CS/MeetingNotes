## 2. Research

SAND as an aim for current Firefighter work paper:
 - Need to tell a story about cost function being dynamic to justify for mostly dynamic networks
 - Could be rejected just because it's not a temporal network paper
 - Paper must be: true, readable and time-y

Introduction:
 - Massage to emphasise dynamic nature
 - People have considered FF on temporal networks (see Sam ...), we are doing a different dynamic aspect of this problem

Background:
 - Maybe remove (at least remove) MSO stuff

Section 3:
 - Start with what we've investigated is a variety of different cost functions
 - Some info about dynamic process (different types of cost) can be in intro
 - Cost functions:
	 - Static, no dependence on time or state
		 - Not dynamic, just regular FF (weighted and budgeted)
	 - Dependence on time, not on state
		 - PathContainable only on very trivial cases
	 - Dependence on state, not time
		 - Focused mostly on this, have a special case where PC is true
	 - Dependence on state and time
 - Most general cost function should go in the problem instance
 - MAKE SURE I SAY PATHCONTAINABLE INSTANCES IN ALL RESULTS (see P_k-free section)
 - MAKE SURE THIS WORKS FOR GRAPHS OF BOUNDED DEGREE - EITHER A PATH OR A CYCLE BURNS IN GRAPHS CASE, IF TREES NEED TO SAY MSO RESULT COVERS TREE CASES AND EXPLAIN WHY ALL ARE INCLUDED IF CORSELLE IS SUPERSET RESULT

## 3. Plan

- Jess to read when possible (correctness)
- Ethan try and figure out interval graph results
- By Jan, could get friend to have another look at MSO
- Time spin: writing introduction and organising later results in terms of hierarchy of dynamic cost functions. Change overarching story to emphasise temporality, explain temporal aspects of FF already explored.
- More eyes to check various results?
- Look at last year's SAND papers to get an impression of what was accepted
- Put in LIPIcs format, see what that looks like, max. 15 pages.
- More results would make a stronger paper (obviously)
- May not need PC.2 for interval graphs
	- Was it even true in static case? Check original proof to see

Results shopping:
 - Periodic cost functions (seasonal)
 - Monotonic or one-switching - go from 1 to 2 (or reverse), depends only on time
