## Abstract
Authors consider deterministic discrete-timemodel of fire spread as given originally by Hartnell. Note that only two firefighters required per time step in the two-dimensional lattice to contain an outbreak. Conjecture that $2d-1$ firefighters are required per time step to contain a fire outbreak starting at a single vertex in the $d$-dimensional square lattice for $d\geq3$, for each positive integer $f$ there exists some outbreak of fire s.t. $f$ firefighters per time step are insufficient to contain the outbreak.

Authors aim to prove another conjecture of Wang and Moeller that the proportion of elements in three-dimensional grid $P_n\cross P_n \cross P_n$ that can be saved with one firefighter per time step when an outbreak starts at one vertex goes to $0$ as $n$ becomes large.

They end by using integer programming to prove results regarding the minimum number of time steps required and minimum number of burnt vertices when containing a fire outbreak in the two-dimensional square lattice with two firefighters per time step.
