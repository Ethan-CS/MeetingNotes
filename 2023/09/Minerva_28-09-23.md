# Minerva Meeting

28-09-2023

Anna, Ed, Ethan, Quintin

## 1. Notes

 - Ed started on spatial skills, struggling with timetabling due to maths and physics clashes.
### Tutor course
- Mondays from noon (SAWB 422/423 on central timetabling now). 14:30 - 16:00 on Mondays in 422 from now on.
 - Recruitment - Anna to send email to research-students@dcs.gla.ac.uk to advertise course.
 - Could ask previous participants to help facilitate discussion.
 - FIRST SESSION: 23rd October, Quintin teaching 
 - In each session, could dedicate some time for contextualising learning? Resource creation, activities, etc.
 - Some feedback previous session: would like to know what they will be learning, can we give a structure/skeleton this time?
 - Assessments - more formative, some of all weekly reflections.

### New Minervas
 - One FATA, one GLASS, both from Glasgow
 - Weekly Minerva meetings?
 - Ask what they're up to taking on based on past experience?
 - Encourage them to come to tutor course at least for first semester, perhaps they will be willing to take on some teaching in second semester for tutor training course.
 - Raises questions about the role of minervas generally...
 - Key: not expected to be leaders from day 1. Does this mean they aren't involved in leadership discussions from the start?
 - Tutor forum/town hall to ensure tutors don't feel detached from what we as minervas are doing? This would help us identify other senior tutors for leadership, help in coordinating tutor body.
 - State-of-the-nation report: what have we learned as senior tutors in the past year? Where are we at with self-defining minerva role? What should a tutor body look like, how should it be defined and organised?
	 - Roadmap doc about Minervas, with series of initiatives
 - Mireilla would like to be more involved; our aim is to get GTAs more engaged and involved in teaching generally beyond turning up and getting paid. How can we make teaching more effective in general?
 - What would coordinating the tutor body look like going forward?
 - Joe now line manager for tutors, do we need to loop him into any of these conversations? This is not quite resolved yet, but maybe in future... Mireilla also keen to be involved, although is more on the active teaching in classrooms side.
