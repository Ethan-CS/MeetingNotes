# 1: Introduction

### Questions & thoughts:

Plenty of existing approaches to SIR and SIS (can become reinfected) models on networks. Generally three approaches here:
- Take averages at population level,
- Maintain a probabilistic view where full state space is considered, or
- Modelling starts at level of nodes <- _The approach the authors take._

Existing challenges:
- Extending results for loop-less networks to networks with loops or clustered networks (where clustering and presence of loops is closely related).
- Developing low-dimensional approximate/exact models to match output directly from the stochastic process.
