### Questions & thoughts:

Bayesian inference uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability for an hypothesis as evidence or information becomes available.


**Bayes' Theorem:**
$$
\displaystyle
P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
where
- $A$ and $B$ are events
-  $P(B)\neq0$
-  $P(A|B)$ is the likelihood of $A$ given $B$ is true - conditional probability
-  $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood of $B$ given $A$ is true
-  $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the probabilities of observing $A$ and $B$ respectively - marginal probability
