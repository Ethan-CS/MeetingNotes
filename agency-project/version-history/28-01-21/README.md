## What it does

While still not a fully working version of the project, I have made a large first pass at organising, simplifying and tidying the preliminary accessory code I had written for the previous version [22-01-2021](https://github.com/ethankelly/research/tree/main/agency-project/version-history/22-01-2021). This version does all of the same things, but now has extensive documentation and explanation of methods, where appropriate, so that I can keep my head clear moving forward. I've used Javadoc to do this for each and every method, even if it's a simple getter method, and also created a JUnit test which currently doesn't do anything. This should remind me to use it soon!


The reason I've uploaded this version is that it's the one I'm going to be working on as a basic foundation, so it seems pretty important to back it up now. Now I've worked on most of the code feedback, I can start implementing design discussions once I've thought carefully about correct and effective implementation of each idea and feature.
