## 1. Admin

No JK meetings for the next two weeks (Good Friday tomorrow, 02/04, and the week after BMC-BAMC is running).


## 2. Research

Ethan updated Jess on the progress he has made since last week:
- Still writing notes to form a lit review of the Markovian SIR models on networks he has been using for lots of his work on equations generation and SIRP models, almost finished and ready to write up soon
- Ran the model on various Erdős–Rényi graphs and obtained some plots:

Jess made some very interesting suggestions to explore this more in-depth approach further:
- Instead of plotting number of wins by probability, Ethan should try plotting the percentage infected in the graph by probability - this may show some more interesting behaviour
- Ethan could also consider honing in on the 0 to 0.2 range of densities and run more models with smaller increments here to examine what happens
- Ethan could consider using different graph classes to run similar models.
	- $k$-Regular graphs
	- Preferential attachment graphs
- In the longer term, Ethan could consider implementing a protection allocation that is not uniformly random but rather exhibits a clustering behaviour.

Overall, Jess commented that this work goes a good way to answering the question "which of these strategies are most effective at preventing infection on particular graph classes?"


Ethan and Jess discussed the closure-identification in the above paper and Jess made some very helpful suggestions.
- For identifying cut-vertices, we can assume a connected graph. For each vertex in the graph, remove it and see if we now have at least two components. If we do, the vertex we removed is a cut-vertex.
- Perhaps the best way to determine whether the removal of a given vertex in Ethan's current code results in two (or more) graph components would be to use the shortest path method Ethan already has. In future, he should consider implementing something more efficient but to get started this should be adequate. 
	- For each vertex in the graph, remove it.
	- For each pair of vertices in the remaining graph, if there exists a path between them (i.e. the shortest path is not `Integer.MAX_VALUE`), then move on to the next one. If we identify any pairs where there is no path, we have at least two components and so have identified a cut vertex.
	- NOTE: we probably need to verify that the graphs generated are in fact connected before we start removing vertices!

Ethan also hopes to use the revisit of the original paper to implement a method that can return whether it is feasible to generate a system of equations for a given graph given the strategies for this determination in the original paper.

Ethan and Jess also discussed Ethan writing an abstract for a computational biology conference running for the first time at the University of Glasgow in May. Jess sent some examples of conference abstracts and made some suggestions for structure and explained Ethan could send over a couple of drafts if/when it would be helpful for Jess to review these.

## 3. Plan

Ethan:
- [x] Plotting:
	- [x] Hone in on the range (0, 0.2] for the Erdős–Rényi graphs
	- [x] Try plotting percentage infected instead of number of wins
	- [x] Run the models on different graph classes and produce similar plots
- [ ] Markovian SIR models on networks paper:
	- [ ] Continue with lit review and write up for next time
	- [x] Begin implementing the above approach for identifying cut vertices in graphs as a start in replacing longer equations with closures if/when possible
	- [ ] Try and implement methods that can return whether closures are possible and whether system of equations generation is feasible.
- [ ] Write a draft abstract for the computational biology conference


## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: follow plan as above.

Jess: no follow-up.
