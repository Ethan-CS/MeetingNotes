# PHD MEETING

__Meeting 06__
12-11-2020

_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Ethan explained he and his partner had been informed to self-isolate in the past week until Wednesday 25-11-20 as his partner had been in close contact with a person with a positive COVID test result. For this reason, he has not managed to get much work done on his PhD (as he also has a lot of marking to do, which should be finished by the end of the week) but should be able to get some more done in the week to come.

## 2. Research

Because of the difficult self-isolation situation, Ethan has focused on shorter tasks which needed completing that did not take his attention for long, such as formatting code and improving certain methods. He also managed to split up Classes in his Java project into more meaningful and useful sections, so that the project becomes easier to build upon and expand as he works on it; Jess encouraged this activity.

## 3. Plan
Ethan: (similar to last week)
* Continue work on NaiveOptimalFirefighter.java
  * Email Jess with any roadblocks that seem a quick fix
* Do some reading on complexity theory
* Continue reading/thinking about agency application of Firefighter

## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: continue with plan as above, in particular email Jess if there are any small issues she can look over before next meeting.

Jess: no follow-up.
