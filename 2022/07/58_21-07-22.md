_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Shorter meeting since Jess' time has been taken up by other engagements this week.


## 2. Research

Updates:
- RSE project:
	- Ethan has built a website, capable of data input, just doesn't look very good and isn't connected to a suitable data storage system yet (e.g. a database)
- Eqn gen code
	- Ethan is re-writing this in Python. Good time, since several incorrect results when testing after major overhauls and Python will be more usable moving forward.


Next week, Jess suggested discussing the wider project rather than just updates to take stock of what is in progress, what has been completed and what upcoming goals look like.

Agenda for next meeting to be included in next week meeting notes.



## 3. Plan

**Practical:**
- [ ] Continue re-writing equation generation code in Python
	- [ ] Testing, closure result, solver implementation (SymPy)

**Writing:**
- [ ] Write agenda for next week's meeting

**Planning:**
- [ ] Dig out APR1 for review next week



## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: follow plan, as above,

Jess: no follow-up.


**_Next meeting date: 13:00 (possibly 14:00) 26-07-22_**



_EK 15:41 22-07-22_
