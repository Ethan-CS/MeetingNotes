Endogeneity occurs when a predictive variable $x$ associated with a regression model is correlated with the error term $e$ of the model. Two cases are common:
1. When important variables are omitted from the model (omitted variable bias)
2. When the outcome variable is a predictor of $x$ rather than simply a response to $x$ (simultaneity bias)
