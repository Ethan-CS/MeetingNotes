## Introduction

The authors begin by outlining the original firefighter problem, with the motivation of finding an optimal sequence of defended vertices that minimises the total number of burnt vertices. They go on to note that the fire spread model is relevant in the study of epidemics. Traditionally, epidemological models fail to incorporate spatial information and assume instead that all individuals are well mixed and equally likely to have contact with any other individual.

Terminology:
- Outbreak of fire - occurs at set of root vertices at time $t=0$
- During $t$-th time step for $t>0$, firefighters are deployed to defend $f$ vertices and then the fire spreads to undefended neighbours
- Beginning of the $t$-th time step means *before* the firefighters are deployed and the end of $t$ time steps means after the fire has spread during the $t$-th time step.
- A firefighter can defend neither burnt vertices not previously defended vertices, as neither can catch fire in future
- Once fire has spread to a vertex, it is referred to as burnt thereafter
- A vertex $v$ is saved at the end of the $t$-th time step if there is no path fom $v$ to the root consisting of only burnt and uyndefended vertices at th end of the $t$-th time step

They consider infinite $d$-dimensional square grids $\mathbb{L}^d$. Vertices of $\mathbb{L}^d$ are the points of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with integer coordinates and $x$ is adjacent to $y$ iff $x$ is distance 1 from $y$ in the usual Euclidean $\mathscr{l}_2$.
