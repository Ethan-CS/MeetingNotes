# PHD MEETING

__Meeting 29__
21-05-2021


_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Ethan has spent considerable time this week marking exams and writing his talk for the Computational Biology Conference (next week) so has not managed to get as much research work done as usual.

Jess and Ethan discussed the practicalities of 1PX marking and agreed that Ethan should try to complete 1P marking as soon as possible so that 1PX can be completed next week.


## 2. Research

Ethan still can't find examples of a 'Thesis Statement,' which is for the annual progress review and is (apparently) different to the research title. Jess suggested Ethan could ask a PhD student Ethan knows who has done at least one of these reviews.

Jess then helped Ethan with understanding the combinatorics of the equations generation, as he has gone back to the drawing board in order to understand this better and write more robust and testable code. Ethan should use these ideas and verify notes taken as far as possible in between exam marking.


## 3. Plan

Ethan:
- [ ] More exam marking (1P, 1PX)
- [ ] Verify results discussed with Jess in meeting
- [ ] Address office room situation
- [ ]  Finish conference talk (and slides) for talk at 1pm on Thursday

## 4. Follow-up
