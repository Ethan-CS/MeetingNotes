Java has no default implementation of the graph data structure, but we can use [[Java Collections]] as follows.

**Define a vertex:**
```java
class Vertex {
	String label;
	Vertex(String label) {
	this.label = label;
	}
	
	//equals and hashCode
}
```
Here, `label` can refer to any entity we would represent with a vertex, such as Person or City.
NB: we need to override the  `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods, because they are necessary to work with Java Collections.

We can represent a graph as an [[Definitions/DEF. Adjacency Matrix|adjacency matrix]] or an [[Definitions/DEF. Adjacency List|adjacency list]], but for this example we will use an adjacency list:
```java
class Graph {
	private Map<Vertex, List<Vertex>> adjVertices;
	
	//standard constructor, getters, setters
}
```
We see that the class `Graph` uses `Map` from Collections to define the adjacency list.
