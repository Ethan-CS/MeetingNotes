# PHD MEETING

__Meeting 11__
07-01-2021

_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Ethan explained that he had no experience with Google Scholar so far; Jess provided a helpful explanation and demonstration, particularly in how to find papers citing the paper searched for.

## 2. Research

Ethan has decided to focus on surveying papers that cite the Markovian SIR epidemics on networks paper he finished at the end of last semester, to get a feel for what has been done in this area and what he could possibly do. This would better inform going about the plan from the previous meeting. Ethan mentioned some papers he has found so far, including some work on weighted networks and approximations of SIR epidemics on networks.


## 3. Plan
Ethan: 
* Find the papers citing the Markovian paper and start reading any of interest (i.e. focusing less on reviews/surveys and more on new results)
* Consider the rest of the New Years Quests from last semester, try and come up with any help that could be asked of the J/K meetings

## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: in next meeting, ask Jess about any funding/grant suggestions that could be pursued and also whether Jess has had any luck with memory card scheme.

Jess: nothing to follow up.
