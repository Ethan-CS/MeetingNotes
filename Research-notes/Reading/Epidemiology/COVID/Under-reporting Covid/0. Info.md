## Aim
To estimate the percentage of symptomatic COVID-19 cases reported in different countries using case fatality ratio estimates based on data from the ECDC, correcting for delays between confirmation-and-death.

## Code and data availability

The code is publically available at https://github.com/thimotei/CFR_calculation. The data required for this analysis is a time-series for both cases and deaths, along with the corresponding delay distribution. We scrape this data from ECDC, using the NCoVUtils package.

The under-reporting estimates for all countries can be downloaded as a single .csv file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmmid/cmmid.github.io/master/topics/covid19/reports/under_ascertainment_estimates.csv

Similarly, global prevalence estimates can be downloaded as a single .csv file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cmmid/cmmid.github.io/master/topics/covid19/reports/currentPrevalenceEstimates_12_06_2020.csv
