# PHD MEETING

__Meeting 34__
07-07-2021


_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

No admin to report.


## 2. Research

Ethan updated Jess with his work in the past week, including getting running the C++ code he had mentioned last meeting for a bayesian integration model of FMD epidemics. Ethan also explained he has read a number of papers by Sharkey detailing generation of equations and the master equations that can hopefully lead to Ethan creating a more robust algorithmic approach to equation generation and ultimately solving.


## 3. Plan

Ethan:
- [ ] Continue work on FMD epidemics and meet with collaborator to outline work done so far
- [ ] Continue reading up on master equations and, where possible, use this to return to existing algorithmic approach to equations generation.



## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: follow plan as above.

Jess: no follow-up.
