_Jess Enright,_
_Ethan Kelly_


## 1. Admin

Ethan and Jess discussed practicalities over festive period (holidays).

## 2. Research

Ethan asked Jess to look over Overleaf doc and come up with areas Ethan should try to work on before he goes on holiday and aim to complete when he returns in January. This is detailed below.


## 3. Plan

Medium todo list: 
-   Check proof for prop 3.1 (I don’t think I’ve checked this one carefully)
-   Add to sections with teal text - e.g. 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, etc.
-   Consider plotting the generation/solving time for cycles on the same plot as the paths results (obvs without closures)
-   Improve linking text at the beginning of 2.1: maybe signpost better what’s coming (polynomial numbers of equations, etc)
-   For figure 4: run multiple experiments at each size, and show points or other distribution instead of just the lines - or plot envelopes including all times?
-   Change subscripts in Table 1 to not-subscripts - maybe just remove?

Places to focus:
-   Generate some plot or table for MCMC vs numerical solver results to discuss for new year 
-   Generate E-R density result: how dense does a small graph have to be before numerical solver is infeasible?
-   Adding a generate/solve time for cycles
-   Finish up the John adaptation that you’re doing now.


## 4. Follow-up

Ethan: plan as above.

Jess: No follow up.
