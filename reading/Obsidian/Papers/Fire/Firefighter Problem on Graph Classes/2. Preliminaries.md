# Preliminaries

Throughout, assume simple, undirected, unweighted, connected input graphs.

Graph $G$, set of vertices denoted $V(G)$ and set of edges E(G). Adhere to convention that $n=|V(G)|$ and $m=|E(G)|.$

Given a set $U\subseteq V(G)$, subgraph of $G$ induced by $U$ denoted $G[U]$.

Set of neighbours of a vertex $v$ denoted $N_G(v)$ and $N_G[v]=B_G(v)\cup \{v\}$. For a subset $U\subseteq V(G)$, $N_G(U)=\cup_{u\in U}n(u)\setminus U$ and $N_G[U]=N_G(U)\cup U$. We can drop subscript from $N_G$ whenever graph is clear from context.

Given two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$, a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ is a minimal **$u, v$-separator** if $u$ and $v$ appear in different connected components of $G[V(G)\setminus S]$ and no proper subset of $S$ has this property. A minimal separator is a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ that is a minimal $u, v$-separator for some pair $u, v$ in $G$.

This shows graph classes mentioned in the paper, where forward arrow represents $\supset$. By results, Firefighter can be solved in polynomial time on graph classes in white, it is NP-hard on graph classes in filled ellipses. 

Given integer $k$, denote a path on $k$ vertices and $k-1$ edges by $P_k$. Graph is **$P_k$-free** if it does not contain $P_k$ as induced subgraph.

An **asteroidal triple (AT)** in a graph $G$ is a triple of pairwise, non-adjacent vertices such that there is a path between any two of them that does not contain a neighbour of the third.
