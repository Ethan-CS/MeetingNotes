# MEETING-NOTES

This directory contains rough meeting notes (similar to minutes, but not as formal) from meetings I have had with my PhD supervisor and second supervisor; they detail any administrative discussions, the research I have been doing since the last meeting and what we both hope I should achieve in the week to come. This last point is in a plan and list of any follow-up points for any attendees. The structure of the meeting notes is detailed below:
