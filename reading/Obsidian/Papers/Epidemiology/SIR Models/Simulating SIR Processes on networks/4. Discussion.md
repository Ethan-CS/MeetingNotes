- Authors have **mapped spreading dynamics on networks to an ensemble of weighted networks.** This permits us to **define temporal distance as shortest paths between nodes on an ensemble of weighted networks. **
- They concentrate on the stochastic formulation of generalised continuous and discrete time SIR spreading dynamics without memory (exponential inter-event distribution) and with memory (arbitrary inter-event distributions)
- Problem of shortest path with the stochastic independent and identically distributed weights is extensively researched in theoretical CompSci, probability theory and statistical physics - the general SIR dynamics are exactly represented using networks where edge weights are conditionally independent random variables and only in the special case of spreading they become independent variables (e.g. SI dynamics - $\gamma = 0$ - or SIR with fixed recovery time - $\phi(t) = \delta(t-T)$). 
- Hence, the **mapping to the ensemble of weighted networks provides additional dynamical interpretation of the shortest paths problem in disordered networks.** Up to now, only Independent Cascade spreading models where edge weights are identically distributed weights were connected to the problem of shortest paths on networks but with no connections to disordered networks or bond percolation literature.
- Unline message passing, the framework is applicable for arbitrary network structures without neglecting loops.
- The method presented takes into account dynamical correlations between node states overcoming the assumptions of mean-field like approximations.
- Unlike well-known historic Gillespie or kinetic Monte Carlo methods, we **don't need to specify initial conditions upfront** and we can sample new realisations from the previous ones by making local random peturbations on the weighted networks.
- Authors have shown that for some non-Markovian processes, **average propagation time can scale as a polynomial with system size even if underlying network is small world.**
- In contrast to the Markovian case, this means **for suficiently large systems the disease does not spread globally in a realistic time scale**
- **The framework presented allows for direct applications such as ranking nodes according to characteristic spreading timescale, source detection and time-critical vaccination.**
- Combining mapping framework with existing vaccination strategies is likely to further improve the resuls, especially in time-sensitive scenarios
- Previous studies for estimating the spreading arrival times were concentrated on a global disease spread with different approximations and theoretical understanding of effective distances for metapopulation models.
- Exact mathematical equivalences for mapping generalised spreading dynamics at microscopic level still lacking.
- Further, in a limit of infinite time of the SIR process time, have established a connection with bond percolation theory. Previously, outcome in infinite time of SIR process have been successfully mapped to percolation but not for finite time.
- Contrary to previous source inference studies, estimations with presented method requires same computational effort to sample realisations at an arbitrary point in time $t$ not only for discrete time, but also for continuous time dynamics.
