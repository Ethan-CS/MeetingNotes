## 1. Admin

First meeting since both were on holiday over festive period.

## 2. Research

Updates from last time:
- [ ] Check proof for prop 3.1 (I don’t think I’ve checked this one carefully)
- [ ] Add to sections with teal text - e.g. 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, etc.
- [x] Consider plotting the generation/solving time for cycles on the same plot as the paths results (obvs without closures)
- [x] Improve linking text at the beginning of 2.1: maybe signpost better what’s coming (polynomial numbers of equations, etc)
- [x] For figure 4: run multiple experiments at each size, and show points or other distribution instead of just the lines - or plot envelopes including all times?
- [x] Change subscripts in Table 1 to not-subscripts - maybe just remove?

Places to focus:
- [ ] Generate some plot or table for MCMC vs numerical solver results to discuss for new year 
- [ ] Generate E-R density result: how dense does a small graph have to be before numerical solver is infeasible?
- [x] Adding a generate/solve time for cycles
- [x] Finish up the John adaptation that you’re doing now.
