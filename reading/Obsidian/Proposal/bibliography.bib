	Abstract = {Abstract. Firefighting is a combinatorial optimization problem on graphs that models the problem of determining the optimal strategy to contain a fire and save as much (trees, houses, etc.) from the fire as possible. We study a new version of firefighting, which we call Politician's Firefighting and which exhibits more locality than the classical one-firefighter version. We prove that this locality allows us to develop an O(bn)-time algorithm for this problem on trees, where b is the number of nodes initially on fire. We further prove that Politician's Firefighting is NP-hard on planar graphs of degree at least 5, and we present an O(m + k^2.5 4^k)-time algorithm for this problem on general graphs, where k is the number of nodes that burn using the optimal strategy, thereby proving that it is fixed-parameter tractable. We present experimental results that show that our algorithm's search tree size is in practice much smaller than the worst-case bound of 4^k.},

@article{gleeson14,
	Abstract = {Human activities increasingly take place in online environments, providing novel opportunities for relating individual behaviours to population-level outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a simple generative model for the collective behaviour of millions of social networking site users who are deciding between different software applications. Our model incorporates two distinct components: one is associated with recent decisions of users, and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. Importantly, although various combinations of the two mechanisms yield long-time behaviour that is consistent with data, the only models that reproduce the observed temporal dynamics are those that strongly emphasize the recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity. This demonstrates---even when using purely observational data without experimental design---that temporal data-driven modelling can effectively distinguish between competing microscopic mechanisms, allowing us to uncover new aspects of collective online behaviour.},

	Abstract = {A model for the spreading of online information or `memes' on multiplex networks is introduced and analyzed using branching-process methods. The model generalizes that of (Gleeson et al 2016 Phys. Rev. X) in two ways. First, even for a monoplex (single-layer) network, the model is defined for any specific network defined by its adjacency matrix, instead of being restricted to an ensemble of random networks. Second, a multiplex version of the model is introduced to capture the behavior of users who post information from one social media platform to another. In both cases the branching process analysis demonstrates that the dynamical system is, in the limit of low innovation, poised near a critical point, which is known to lead to heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity similar to those observed in empirical data.},

@article{pastor01,
	Abstract = {The Internet has a very complex connectivity recently modeled by the class of scale-free networks. This feature, which appears to be very efficient for a communications network, favors at the same time the spreading of computer viruses. We analyze real data from computer virus infections and find the average lifetime and persistence of viral strains on the Internet. We define a dynamical model for the spreading of infections on scale-free networks, finding the absence of an epidemic threshold and its associated critical behavior. This new epidemiological framework rationalizes data of computer viruses and could help in the understanding of other spreading phenomena on communication and social networks.},

	Abstract = {The Firefighter problem aims to save as many vertices of a graph as possible from a fire that starts in a vertex and spreads through the graph. At every time step a new firefighter may be placed on some vertex, and then the fire advances to every vertex that is not protected by a firefighter and has a neighbor on fire. The problem is notoriously hard: it is NP-hard even when the input graph is a bipartite graph or a tree of maximum degree 3, it is NP-hard to approximate within n 1− for any  > 0, and it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of saved vertices. We show that Firefighter can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs, split graphs, permutation graphs, and Pk-free graphs for fixed k. To complement these results, we show that the problem remains NP-hard on unit disk graphs.

This is the general setup for The Firefighter Problem, which has attracted considerable attention since being introduced in 1995. We survey the directions and results that have been pursued, including algorithms and complexity, bounds, and containing the fire on infinite grids.
